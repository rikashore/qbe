                ===================
                Windows Quick Start
                ===================

Only 64bits versions of windows are supported.  To compile
this software you will need to get a normal UNIX toolchain.
There are several ways to do this, but I will present what
I found to be the easiest and lightest solution.

 1. Download and install [@1 MSYS2] (the x86_64 version).
 2. In an MSYS2 terminal, run the following command.

        pacman -S git make mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb

 3. Restart the MSYS2 terminal.
 4. In the new terminal, clone QBE.
 
        git clone git://c9x.me/qbe.git

 5. Compile using `make`.
