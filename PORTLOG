Introduce Target struct, try to make live.c
architecture independent, try to understand
arm abi.

2017/3/6 - (0945 to 1050)
Finish making live.c arch-independent.
Spill.c was also easy, remains to see how
opdesc should be modified.  Architecture
dependent pass declarations moved into
arch-x64/arch.h.

2017/3/6 - (2130 to 2240)
Make rega.c arch-independent.  That was
easy.  Put a little more work in the .h
organization.  Change some naming
conventions, pure x64 functions have
prefix x_, and x64_sysv functions have
prefix xv_.

Do not include architecture specific
headers in all.h.  More reading on ARM
assembly.  Compiled a mapping from qbe
condition codes to ARM.  I think I will
change enum Jmp and replace x64-specific
jumps with normal qbe int/float
comparison codes.  The mapping will be
done by the emitter.  Similarly, I
might get rid of Oxset.

2017/3/7 - (1630 to 1800)
Got rid of x64-specific comparisons in
most of qbe.

2017/3/9
Use a new ops.h to store various pieces of
information about operations.  That way,
there is only one file to change when new
instructions appear, but I can still
provide abstraction for the various
backends.
